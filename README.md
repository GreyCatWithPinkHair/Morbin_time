# Morbin_time
Um, so this is the lab for this term, m-key?..
I upload this very late because of a variety of reasons, including late start, constantly changing plans and wierl mental fluctuations.
But anyway, we're here, so I might as well describe the program

This is numerical system converter!
It takes a number in the "Input" field and bases in the fields below
and then it converts the number from the system of the Old base to the system of the New base,
giving the result in the "Output" field.

I also wanted to give it at least a little bit of... Soul? Maybe?..
So there's a field for that - a field where it can give some non mechanical output, if that makes sense.

That's probably it. I don't know what else to say.
